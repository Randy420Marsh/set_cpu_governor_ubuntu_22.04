I had the same problem with my AMD Ryzen 5 3400G with Radeon Vega Graphics, running Ubuntu 22.04.

I solved the problem as follows :

sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon.service
sudo systemctl stop power-profiles-daemon.service

Then I created three files in the following locations:

    /etc/default/mygovernor

    -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 447 Oct 2 13:11 mygovernor

with the following contents:

# J.T. 2022-10-02
# Environment file for systemd service /etc/systemd/system /mygovernor.service
# which set the cpufreq governor to be used by the system.  A list of supported
# governors may be found by the following command:
# "cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors"
# conservative ondemand userspace powersave performance schedutil

#GOVERNOR=powersave
#GOVERNOR=schedutil
#GOVERNOR=ondemand
GOVERNOR=performance

    /etc/systemd/set-mygovernor

    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 884 Oct 2 13:05 set-mygovernor

with the following contents:

#! /bin/bash
# J.T. 2022-10-02
# This script is called by script /etc/systemd/system/mygovernor.service
# It will set the CPU Frequency Scaling governor to the value passed in
# the first command line argument "$1"

set -eu

FIRSTCPU=$(cut -f1 -d- /sys/devices/system/cpu/online)
AVAILABLE=$(/bin/cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu${FIRSTCPU}/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors)

# Check if the specified commandline governor ID is supported on this PC

GOVERNOR=""

for gov in ${AVAILABLE}; do
    if [[ "${gov}" == "${1}" ]]; then
        GOVERNOR="${gov}"
        break
    fi
done

if [ -z ${GOVERNOR} ]; then
        echo "Unknown governor =" \"${1}\"
       exit 1
fi

echo "Setting CPUFreq Scaling governor = \"$GOVERNOR\" for all CPUs"

for CPUFREQ in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
do
        [ -f "${CPUFREQ}" ] || continue
        echo -n "${GOVERNOR}" > ${CPUFREQ}
done

    /etc/systemd/system/mygovernor.service

with the following contents:

# J.T. 2022-10-02
# This service set the cpufreq scaling governor, to the value of 
# environment variable "GOVERNOR" defined in file "/etc/default/mygovernor"
# This service will not execute unless Ubuntu service "power-profiles-daemon.service"
# is masked. It may be masked with the following command:
# "sudo systemctl mask power-profiles-daemon.service"

[Unit]
Description=Set CPU Frequency Scaling governor
ConditionVirtualization=no
ConditionPathExists=/sys/devices/system/cpu/online

[Service]
Type=idle
EnvironmentFile=/etc/default/mygovernor
ExecCondition=/bin/bash -xc '/bin/systemctl is-masked --quiet power-profiles-daemon.service && exit 1 || exit 0'
ExecStart=/etc/systemd/set-mygovernor ${GOVERNOR}

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

then I enabled and started the new service:

sudo systemctl enable mygovernor.service
sudo systemctl start mygovernor.service

You can monitor your governors with cpufreq-info from the package "cpufrequtils". Or use gkrellm system monitor with cpufreq-utils plugin.

It also works on Ubuntu 20.04 but you have to replace "power-profiles-daemon.service" with "ondemand.service". The rest is the same.

Hope this is what you were looking for. The code is base on a number of examples from the internet but I forgot where so I can't acknowledge them.

To change the governor edit /etc/default/mygovernor and restart mygovernor service.
